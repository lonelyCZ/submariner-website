### Unplanned Work

#### Ongoing Maintenance

Tasks that relate to ongoing maintenance (version bumps, image trimmings, CI and automation) will usually be small and unplanned
tasks that we can't plan ahead for, but we know there will always be work to do.
Use label "maintenance" on the issue.
In case the task has a major effect (e.g. needs more than a few days of work) then it should go through an exception process.
