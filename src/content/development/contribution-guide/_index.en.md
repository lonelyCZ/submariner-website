### Unplanned Work

During the work on a release, there will be tasks which the team have to add to the projects which was unknown at the planning phase.
There are 3 type of those tasks:

* [Bugs](#bugs).
* Ongoing maintenance.
* New [epics](#epics) or independent [tasks](#tasks).

The team triages all tasks and bugs as part of a weekly meeting.
The bugs can be worked on immediately, while other types of issues are described below.

#### Ongoing Maintenance

Tasks that relate to ongoing maintenance (version bumps, image trimmings, CI and automation) will usually be small, unplanned tasks that
typically occur throughout each release cycle. The associated GitHub issue / PR should be labeled as `maintenance`.

#### Exception Process

In some cases, a task or an epic will be reported in the middle of a release cycle.
Small and medium sized tasks will be triaged and prioritized in the same manner as other issues.
Once triaged and prioritized, small and medium tasks can be worked on according to their priority.

Epics would need to undergo an exception process.
The epic's proponent would need to bring it up to discussion in the weekly community meeting.
It's up to them to convince why this issue takes precedence over other pre-planned and triaged issues.
A 50% approval from the project team is required for it to be accepted in the middle of the release.
If the epic is approved during the exception process:

* The team might de-scope other tasks or epics.
* A label `unplanned` should be added to it.
* It would require an enhancement proposal to be drafted and reviewed in the same manner as all other epics.
* If the enhancement proposal is accepted and merged, work on the epic can begin.
